# Monte Carlo Simulation — Evaluating Investments for the 2025 Energy Efficient Challenge
## Project Overview 
This repository contains a quantitative decision-support model developed for Kühle Engler Kraftwagen AG (KEK AG) as part of its 2025 Energy Efficiency Challenge. The project evaluates alternative energy-efficient industrial ovens for the bumper painting department at KEK AG’s main manufacturing site in Germany.

The analysis applies Net Present Value (NPV) over a five-year planning horizon and explicitly incorporates uncertainty in key drivers such as energy prices, production volumes, failure rates, maintenance costs, capacity constraints, and government subsidies. To move beyond a purely deterministic investment appraisal, the project uses a Monte Carlo simulation framework to assess risk–return trade-offs and support robust managerial decision-making.

The repository includes the core simulation model, assumptions, and analyses designed to provide transparent, decision-relevant insights aligned with KEK AG’s long-term energy efficiency and cost competitiveness objectives.
